# Exercise 4.4 The letters of the alphabet can be constructed from a moderate
# number of basic elements, like vertical and horizontal lines and a few
# curves. Design a font that can be drawn with a minimal number of basic
# elements and then write functions that draw letters of the alphabet.
# You should write one function for each letter, with names draw_a, draw_b,
# etc., and put your functions in a file named letters.py. You can download
# a “turtle typewriter” from 
# thinkpython.com/code/typewriter.py to help you test your code.
# You can download a solution from thinkpython.com/code/letters.py.
