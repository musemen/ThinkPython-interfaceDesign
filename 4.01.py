# Exercise 4.1 Download the code in this chapter from 
# thinkpython.com/code/polygon.py.
# 1. Write appropriate docstrings for polygon, arc and circle.
# 2. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program while executing
# circle(bob, radius). You can do the arithmetic by hand or add print
# statements to the code.
# 3. The version of arc in Section 4.7 is not very accurate because the linear
# approximation of the circle is always outside the true circle. As a result,
# the turtle ends up a few units away from the correct destination. My
# solution shows a way to reduce the effect of this error. Read the
# code and see if it makes sense to you. If you draw a diagram, you might see
# how it works.
